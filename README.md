# Wild-West-Virginia-Blog
A nature blog website created with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. JavaScript functionality coming soon. Eventually will contain a backend and will be a fully functional and interactive site hosted on the internet.
This is the second website I have built from scratch on my journey to learn web development. The initial goal of this project is to develop and practice basic skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript without modifying an existing website template.
The end goal of this project is to create a fully-functional and interactive live website.
